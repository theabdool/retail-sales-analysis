### Project Title
Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard (2019–2024)
### Description
This analyzing retail performance across revenue, transaction volume, profit margin, and discount trends from 2019 to 2024. It provides insights into top products, customer age groups, purchase methods, and city-wise profitability.
### Problem Statement
Retail companies struggle to:
- Forecast revenue accurately
- Track performance by age group, city, and product category
- Optimize discount strategies and purchase methods
This dashboard enables data-driven decisions by providing real-time, interactive views of key retail KPIs.
### Tools Used
Tableau – Data visualization, forecasting, trend analysis
Data Source – cleaned retail transactions with age, product category, and payment method
Excel/CSV – for raw data preprocessing 
### Process Summary
**Data Cleaning:** Cleaned retail transactions, merged customer and product data
**Data Modeling:** Established dimensions (age group, location, payment method) and measures (net revenue, discount %, profit)
**Dashboard Design:**
  - Slicers for Year, Month, Category, Location
  - KPIs: Revenue, Profit Margin, # of Customers, Discount Rate
  - Forecast visual and YoY % changes
  - Visual comparisons across age groups, cities, and categories
### Key Insights
- Total Net Revenue (2021): $98.27M (↑ 3% vs LY)
- Total Customers: $18.81B across all years
- High-Value Transactions peak in 25–45 age group with 13K+ transactions
- Credit Cards drive the highest revenue ($46.42M)
- Mumbai and Delhi lead in profit ($1.3M and $1.2M)
- Discount Rate: Averaging 8.68%, slightly down YoY
- Profit Margin is shrinking (1.8%), signaling rising costs or heavier discounting
### Recommendations
- Target 25–45 age group with loyalty and personalized offers
- Reduce discount rates strategically, especially for high-performing categories
- Encourage debit/online payments with cashback to offset declining margins
- Invest in top-performing cities (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi) with geo-targeted campaigns
- Boost low-profit categories like Pet Care and Toys via bundling or pricing strategies
- Forecasting shows consistent revenue climb—use this to inform inventory planning
### Challenges & Fixes
- Complex filtering slowed performance → Used context filters and simplified joins
- Forecasting visuals cluttered → Smoothed using rolling averages
- Color conflicts on YoY indicators → Used green/red scheme with % delta tags
